# New York City Cab Rides Analysis

## Description

In this analysis, I used the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) dataset of February 2019 with 26+MM taxi trip records of Green Taxi, Yellow Taxi, Limo, Juno, Uber, Lyft and Via. Taken as a whole, the detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pick up and drop off coordinates: itâ€™s a story of New York.
